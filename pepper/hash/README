example developed for "proving we know the preimage of a hash" in zk.
hopefully useful for proxy voting project

to play, try the following from the pequin/pepper directory:

# builds relevant executables
# only have to do this once

./setup-hash.sh

# hashes offline (only uses first 64 characters of your argument, pads with underscores if argument is fewer than 64 chars)
# copies public and private inputs to relevant dirs
# run this for every new example

./prepare-hash.sh stringyouwanttohash

# prove

./prove hash

# verify

./verify hash
